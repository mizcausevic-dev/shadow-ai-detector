# Why We Built This

**shadow-ai-detector** started from a recurring problem in platform governance: teams had more signal than operational clarity. That difference between visibility and usability kept showing up under pressure.

The recurring pressure in this space showed up around policy drift, observability blind spots, and fragmented evidence during incident or review pressure. In practice, that meant teams could collect logs, metrics, workflow state, documents, or events and still not have a good answer to the hardest questions: what is drifting, what matters first, who owns the next move, and what evidence supports that move? Once a system reaches that point, the problem is no longer only technical. It becomes operational.

That is why **shadow-ai-detector** was built the way it was. The repo is a deliberate attempt to model a real operating layer for platform, security, reliability, and governance teams. It is not just trying to present data attractively or prove that a stack can be wired together. It is trying to show what happens when evidence, prioritization, and next-best action are treated as first-class product concerns.

Existing tools helped with adjacent workflows. SIEMs, monitoring platforms, governance workflows, and static policy tools covered storage, reporting, scanning, or execution in pieces. What they still missed was a cleaner operator view tying evidence, control posture, and next action together. That left operators reconstructing the story manually at exactly the moment they needed clarity.

That shaped the design philosophy:

- **operator-first** so the riskiest or most time-sensitive signal is surfaced early
- **decision-legible** so the logic behind a recommendation can be understood by humans under pressure
- **review-friendly** so the repo supports discussion, governance, and iteration instead of hiding the reasoning
- **CI-native** so checks and narratives can live close to the build and change process

This repo also avoids trying to be a vague platform for everything. Its value comes from being opinionated about a real problem: Detect unauthorized LLM usage across enterprise networks. Endpoint catalog, traffic pattern analysis, payload sensitivity scanning, department-level shadow-AI exposure rollups, and CISO-ready incident reporting.

What comes next is practical. The roadmap is about historical baselines, deeper policy authoring, and stronger export into broader operational review loops. The long-term value of **shadow-ai-detector** is that it makes that operating layer concrete enough to review, improve, and trust.
